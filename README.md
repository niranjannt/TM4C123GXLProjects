TM4C123GXL Embedded Systems Projects

This repository showcases multiple embedded systems projects developed on the Texas Instruments TM4C123GXL (Tiva C Series LaunchPad) microcontroller using C and Code Composer Studio. Each project integrates timers, GPIO, LCD display, and audio feedback to create interactive real-time systems.

🟢 Simon Says Memory Game
📖 Overview

A memory-based game inspired by Simon Says, where the player must replicate increasingly long LED sequences. Audio tones and LCD feedback provide an interactive gaming experience.

⚙️ Features

LED sequence generation and playback using SysTick and Timer1A

Audio tones for each LED via a 4-bit resistor DAC

Correct/incorrect feedback using buzzer and “ding” tones

LCD messages: "Round X Passed" or "Game Over"

Dynamic sequence-tracking logic with arrays and GPIO switch validation

📷 Example Workflow

System flashes an LED sequence (e.g., Red → Green → Yellow).

Player reproduces the sequence with the corresponding switches.

If correct, a new round begins with an extended sequence.

If incorrect, the game ends with a buzzer sound and "Game Over" on the LCD.

🔴 LED Reaction Time Game
📖 Overview

The Reaction Time Game tests how fast a user responds to an LED turning on. Reaction times are measured in milliseconds and displayed on the LCD.

⚙️ Features

Random LED activation with SysTick

Reaction time measurement using Timer1A

Switch-based user input detection

LCD result display: "Reaction Time: XXX ms"

📷 Example Workflow

After a random delay, an LED lights up.

User presses the switch as quickly as possible.

The system calculates and displays the reaction time.

⏱️ Digital Stopwatch
📖 Overview

A digital stopwatch with start, stop, and reset controls. Displays the elapsed time on the LCD in HH:MM:SS format.

⚙️ Features

Stopwatch controlled by GPIO switches (Start, Stop, Reset)

Time tracked by Timer1A with second-level granularity

Tick sound generated with SysTick + DAC

LCD updates dynamically with the current stopwatch value

📷 Example Workflow

Press Start to begin timing.

Press Stop to pause.

Press Reset to clear the stopwatch.

LCD continuously updates with elapsed time.

🛠️ Hardware Components

TM4C123GXL Tiva C Series LaunchPad

ST7735 LCD (SPI interface)

4-bit Resistor DAC + Piezo Buzzer (for audio tones)

Onboard LEDs (red, green, yellow)

Push-button switches (GPIO inputs)

📑 Development Tools

Language: C

IDE: Code Composer Studio

Debugger/Programmer: Onboard ICDI

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository.

Open the project in Code Composer Studio.

Connect the TM4C123GXL via USB.

Build and flash the program.

Interact with the game/stopwatch using the switches and LCD.

📌 Future Improvements

Simon Says: Add difficulty scaling and high-score tracking

Reaction Game: Support multiple rounds with average time scoring

Stopwatch: Add lap-time functionality

👉 Do you want me to make this one README for all three projects together, or should I create a folder structure with three subprojects each having their own README (so they look cleaner on GitHub)?
